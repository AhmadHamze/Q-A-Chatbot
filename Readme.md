# Q&A Chatbot

This is a dummy project to learn how to create a chatbot using Python, LLMs, and related technologies.

## Usage

First, create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv env
```
Make sure it it activated:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After the installation is complete, create a file named `project_secret.py`, inside it you have to store your API key like this:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```
